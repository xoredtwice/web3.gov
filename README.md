This paper explores the challenges of centralized governance in digital platforms like the metaverse or sharing economy. It proposes that blockchain-based governance and open standards could address issues of monopolization. Through empirical analysis of a blockchain-based virtual world's governance data, the study finds that while such decentralized systems are crucial, they are not entirely effective in preventing centralization and concentrated power, which can lead to various economic problems. The authors emphasize the importance for stakeholders in evaluating a platform's governance structure before participating.
