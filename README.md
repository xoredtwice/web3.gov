## Web3 Governance

### [The exchange theory of web3 governance (2022)](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/kykl.12345)

This paper presents a public choice approach to analyzing governance decisions in the context of Web3, contrasting it with the traditional romantic view of collective decision-making. It explores how individuals in Web3 communities, likened to states, make governance choices that are most beneficial to their private interests, particularly in regards to revenue generation and treasury spending. The paper also discusses constitutional-level changes in Web3 governance, highlighting participatory community decision-making and the potential for governance change through forking, which is decentralized and permissionless.

The paper argues that governance is essential for blockchains due to contractual incompleteness and the need to address emerging issues such as bugs or code upgrades. It differentiates between governance of blockchains (managed by foundations and committees) and governance by blockchains (as in DAOs), and suggests that corporate governance frameworks are more apt for understanding blockchain governance compared to political governance models.

Furthermore, the paper explores how governance in Web3 creates value not only through decision-making but also by expanding possibilities for new exchanges through political entrepreneurship. This innovation in governance is likened to technological innovations that create lasting value.

Several case studies, including Curve Finance, Lido, and the Meta-governance Project, are presented to illustrate these concepts. These examples show how Web3 governance mechanisms, enabled by lower costs of experimentation, facilitate entrepreneurship and discovery of value. They highlight how governance in Web3 is a discovery process under uncertainty, with governance rights being exchanged and coordinated through innovative means.

The paper concludes by asserting that governance innovation in Web3 can be a significant source of value creation. It cautions against overly simplistic governance systems and emphasizes the potential costs of minimizing governance innovation. The paper suggests that more research is needed into the implications of these insights for traditional governance processes, and it anticipates further exploration into the frontiers of Web3 governance.

### [2023. Algorithmic governance, code as law, and the blockchain common: Power relations in the blockchain-based society](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2023.1109544/full)

This paper critically examines the concept of "Code is Law" in the context of Web3 and blockchain technology, tracing its origins to Lawrence Lessig's discussions during the early days of the internet and Web2. It explores how the rise of smart contracts and blockchain technology have given new meaning to this concept, suggesting a shift towards a more algorithm-driven governance system that promises fairness and objectivity. However, the paper highlights the challenges and limitations of such a system, noting that many individuals do not conform to standard statistical models and may be disadvantaged by algorithmic governance.

The paper discusses the potential of blockchain and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) in creating a decentralized society where governance is based on consensus and collective decision-making through tokens. While Web3 promises to shift power from governments and corporations to individuals and token holders, the paper questions whether this will result in a fairer society.

The discussion includes a comparison of power relations in pre-internet, Web1, Web2, and the envisioned Web3 societies. It notes that while the internet initially promised decentralization and participatory systems, Web2 ended up centralizing power with tech giants who control information access. The paper explores how blockchain technology might change these dynamics but cautions that new power struggles could emerge, particularly in controlling the code that governs society.

The paper concludes by suggesting that Web3, like its predecessors, is subject to similar power dynamics and struggles. It questions whether blockchain technology can truly deliver on its promise of a decentralized, fair society, and highlights the potential for continued power imbalances and struggles for control over the governing code.

### [2023. Designing reward systems for Web3 governance](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/designing-reward-systems-for-web3-governance/)

This article delves into the challenge of democratizing online governance systems, focusing on incentivizing long-term civic participation through rewards. It examines the limitations of current web3 governance systems that rely on transferable tokens, such as tendencies toward plutocracy and low resilience to Sybil attacks. The author suggests alternatives to coin voting, comparing reputation-based and token-based reward systems for governance participation. The historical context shows that political influence has often been wealth-based rather than merit-based, from Ancient Rome to modern liberal democracies.

The paper discusses the difficulty of scaling reputation-based systems, which have been used throughout history in various forms, from medieval guilds to modern credit ratings. It also acknowledges the challenges of existing digital reputation systems, like Google’s PageRank or Reddit’s karma score, which are often niche-specific and prone to fraud.

In the realm of web3, the author sees potential in designing and implementing scalable, merit-based online governance systems using blockchain technology. Two key questions are raised: what behaviors should be rewarded, and who should be rewarded? The paper suggests that in web3 governance, a mix of reputation-based and token-based systems might be optimal, with each having its own trade-offs in terms of accessibility, sybil resistance, and scalability.

The article concludes by highlighting the ongoing debate and experimentation in the space of online democratic governance, emphasizing the need to move beyond simple token-based systems to foster true meritocracy in decentralized governance structures.

### [2023. A Comprehensive Study of Governance Issues in Decentralized Finance Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01433.pdf)

This paper conducts a comprehensive study of governance issues in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a key application of smart contracts offering an alternative to centralized finance. The study analyzes 4,446 audit reports from 17 Web3 security companies to categorize governance issues in DeFi applications, using a specially developed taxonomy. It identifies vulnerabilities in governance design and implementation, like flash loan and re-entrancy attacks. Employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the paper highlights challenges in maintaining consistency between DeFi applications' code and their whitepapers. 

The authors also develop and test an AI-based prototype tool on eight DeFi projects, achieving significant accuracy and recall rates. This research aims to assist those involved in DeFi - designers, developers, users, researchers, and regulators - in understanding and addressing governance challenges to promote the sector's healthy development.

### [2023. Metaverse governance: An empirical analysis of voting within Decentralized Autonomous Organizations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296323001224)

In this paper we explore the importance of platform governance. We discuss various problems of centralized architecture in the context of the metaverse or sharing economy applications which may lead to monopoly market structures. We argue that open standards and lockchain-based governance can potentially mitigate some of these issues. We then collect governance data from the first blockchain-based virtual world and conduct an empirical analysis to study voter behavior within Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). 
The paper
 provides empirical evidence that open standards and blockchain-based governance are a necessary but not a sufficient condition for a decentralized and neutral platform. Centralization and concentrated voting power may lead to dependencies, rent extraction behavior and create hold-up problems. Consequently, producers, prosumers and service providers must evaluate the governance structure of the platform before establishing a presence.

### [2023. Web3 Governance Models](https://www.hiro.so/blog/web3-governance-models-an-introduction-to-the-decision-making-process-in-web3-projects)

This article provides an in-depth overview of Web3 governance, explaining its importance in decentralized systems and the various models available for implementation in Web3 projects.

+ Benefits of Community Governance in Web3 Projects:

    + __Decentralization__: Embracing a Web3 governance model can further decentralize a project, aligning with the ethos of Web3 and potentially reaching a broader audience.

    + __Wisdom of the Crowd__: Utilizing the collective knowledge and expertise of a community can lead to better decision-making compared to relying solely on a core team.

    + __Transparency and Accountability__: Governance models that involve the community enhance transparency and accountability, fostering trust and preventing power abuse.

    + __Risk Management and Stability__: Effective governance models can provide clear frameworks for dispute resolution and ensure project continuity even after the departure of founding members.

    + __Community Engagement__: Active governance encourages community participation, fostering a deeper connection and commitment to the project.

+ Types of Web3 Governance Models:

    + __Direct On-Chain Democracy__: Allows all community members to vote directly on proposals with votes recorded on the blockchain, but risks plutocracy where wealthier members have more influence.

    + __Direct Off-Chain Democracy__: Similar to on-chain democracy but voting occurs off the blockchain, which can be faster and cheaper but introduces trust and security concerns.

    + __Representative Democracy__: Like traditional government systems, this model elects representatives to make decisions, balancing efficient decision-making with community input.

    + __Athenian Sortition__: Randomly assigns decision-making power to community members to prevent power concentration, but may result in uninformed or unrepresentative decision-making.

    + __Quadratic Democracy__: Considers both the number of votes and unique voters to prevent the richest participants from dominating the decision-making process.

+ Choosing the Right Web3 Governance Model:

    The selection of a governance model depends on various factors, including the __desired level of decentralization__, __community size__, and __required security level__. In the early stages of a project, it may be beneficial for founders to maintain decision-making control to develop their vision and achieve product-market fit. As the project matures, transitioning to a more decentralized governance model can be considered. It's important to stay flexible and adapt the governance model as the project and the Web3 industry evolve.

### [Web3 implications of blockchain mutations for internet governance](https://www.gcr21.org/publications/gcr/gcr-quarterly-magazine/qm-2-3/2022-articles/qm-2/3-2022-campbell-verduyn-and-huetten-from-peer-regulated-divisions-to-unity-in-web3-implications-of-blockchain-mutations-for-internet-governance)

This article discusses the evolution of blockchain technology and its implications for Internet governance, particularly focusing on the emerging concept of Web3.

Key Points:

__Blockchain Technology__: Introduced with Bitcoin in 2009, blockchains allow digital transactions to be verified and recorded in a decentralized manner. They do not rely on a central authority like a bank or government, instead using a network consensus to confirm transactions. This technology is viewed as enhancing trust in the Internet and providing a form of digital peer regulation.

__Blockchain's Impact and Controversies__: Blockchains have captured public attention and resources across various sectors. The technology has been both celebrated for its potential and criticized for enabling scams and fraud. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are examples of blockchain applications that have gone through cycles of hype and skepticism.

__Web3 - A Push for Unity__: Web3, starting to emerge in 2021, is seen as a unifying movement in the blockchain space, seeking to return to the decentralized nature of the early Internet (Web 1.0). Unlike the fragmented and factional landscape of previous blockchain applications, Web3 aims for greater interoperability among various blockchain protocols and with existing Web 2.0 structures.

__Implications for Internet Governance__: The push for unity in Web3 tends to emphasize technical interoperability at the cost of socio-economic diversity. Web3 is critiqued for reproducing existing socio-economic inequalities and for its narrow focus on technical aspects rather than broader inclusivity.

__Regulatory Responses__: As blockchain applications grow, they face increased regulatory scrutiny globally. This has prompted Web3 advocates to emphasize self-regulation and interoperability as a way to avoid or pre-empt official regulatory control.

__Challenges and Future Directions__: Despite its promise, the unity in Web3 might not last, as it raises high expectations and faces debates about its role in Internet governance. The article suggests that the future of the Internet, be it Web3, Web 4.0, or Web5, should focus on overcoming the challenges of Web 2.0 rather than recreating them.

### [What Web3 organizations can learn from governance history](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/faculty-research/publications/lightspeed-democracy-what-web3-organizations-can-learn-history)

### [2022.Web3 wrong question](https://www.wired.com/story/web3-blockchain-decentralization-governance/)

This article discusses the concept of decentralization in the context of Web3 and expresses concerns about the current direction of decentralization in this domain. Authored by Divya Siddarth, Danielle Allen, and E. Glen Weyl, the article argues that while decentralization can combat issues like erosion of freedom and economic stagnation, the focus should be on the type of decentralization rather than its degree.

Key Points of the Article:

+ __Misguided Focus on Degree of Decentralization__: The authors argue that Web3’s focus on the degree of decentralization rather than its type can lead to misconceptions about both existing centralization and the feasibility of complete decentralization. They note that existing systems, often labeled as centralized, have elements of decentralization, and that extreme decentralization in Web3 could lead to inefficiencies and the re-emergence of centralized entities.

+ __Inefficiencies and Contradictions in Narrow Technical Decentralization__: The article points out that the narrow technical approach to decentralization in Web3, such as in distributed ledgers, faces inherent contradictions. This approach can result in either reduced functionality or the emergence of some form of centralized decision-making.

+ __The Value of Decentralization in Empowering Action__: Decentralization, according to the authors, should empower people to act decisively within their social contexts while allowing for coordination across different contexts. This contrasts with the current trend where decision-making is often centralized in the hands of distant authorities.

+ __Composable Local Control as an Alternative__: The authors propose a model of decentralization based on composable local control. This model focuses on solving problems through federations of local units that are relevant to the decision at hand. This approach draws on the principle of subsidiarity, which emphasizes solving problems at the most immediate level that is feasible.

+ __Challenges with Distributed Redundancy__: The current Web3 model, which relies on distributed redundancy, is critiqued for removing data from its social context, aiming for universal solutions, and depending on global consensus. This model is seen as being in tension with subsidiary networks.

+ __Potential for Web3 to Redirect Towards Subsidiarity__: The authors express optimism that Web3 and related technologies can shift towards a model of subsidiarity. However, they emphasize the need for Web3 to evolve into a network of networks, rather than just a ledger.

+ __Efficiency and Security in Subsidiarity__: Contrary to the distributed redundancy model, subsidiarity can increase efficiency by leveraging trust and relationships, rather than diminishing efficiency to eliminate the need for trust.

### [ChainLink: DAO complexities](https://blog.chain.link/daos/)

This comprehensive article from Chainlink provides an in-depth exploration of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and their role in the governance of Web3. It covers various aspects of DAOs, including their types, responsibilities, tooling, governance structures, benefits, trade-offs, and the future outlook.

Key-points:

+ __Definition and Purpose of DAOs__: DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) are blockchain-based structures for collective decision-making. They are not fully autonomous as they require human interaction for functions like voting and deploying code. DAOs use smart contracts to execute decisions and assign ownership.

+ __Types of DAOs__: The article categorizes DAOs into several types including Protocol DAOs, Investment DAOs, Cause-based DAOs, Social DAOs, Data DAOs, and Network States. Each type serves different purposes, from managing decentralized applications to making investments or supporting specific causes.

+ __Responsibilities of DAOs__:Responsibilities include managing open-source protocol upgrades, setting parameters within decentralized applications (dApps), directing protocol-owned funds, and more.

+ __DAO Tooling__:Tools essential for DAO functioning are outlined, such as governance tokens, multi-signature wallets, voting contracts, delegation systems, off-chain snapshots, discussion forums, and reputation systems.


+ __Governance Structures in DAOs__:The article discusses various governance structures like direct on-chain democracy, direct off-chain democracy, representative democracy, and quadratic democracy, explaining how they function and their implications.

+ __Benefits of DAOs__: Benefits include transparency, democratization, trust-minimization, and global participation.

+ __Tradeoffs and Challenges in DAO Governance__: Key trade-offs are analyzed across multiple dichotomies such as Early-Stage vs. Late-Stage Members, Decentralization vs. Efficiency, Stabilization vs. Growth, Leaderless vs. Leadership, Short-Term vs. Long-Term Priorities, Knowledgeable vs. Unknowledgeable Members, and Nothing-at-Stake vs. Hyper-Financialization.

+ __The Future of DAOs__: The article acknowledges that DAOs are still in their infancy and their evolution is uncertain. It highlights the need for experimentation to develop diverse and effective governance models.

## Voting over blockchain

### [Blockchains and Voting: Somewhere between hype and a panace](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Blockchains-and-Voting%3A-Somewhere-between-hype-and-Nasser-Okoye/397f569d89af9c35f5fa67c738e2f705bb328368)

This position paper by Yomna Nasser, Chidinma Okoye, Jeremy Clark, and Peter Y.A. Ryan explores the potential and limitations of blockchain technology in the context of voting systems. The authors systematically examine both the challenges of implementing a voting system on a blockchain and how blockchain might enhance existing verifiable voting systems. They conclude that while blockchains can be a useful augmentation for verifiable voting in certain circumstances and may introduce innovative ways of voting in non-traditional settings, they are not a panacea for all voting system issues.

Paper key-points:

+ __Blockchain as a Voting System Base__: The paper begins by considering the challenges of building a voting system on a blockchain, including issues related to voter anonymity, registration, and the transparency of the voting process.

+ __Enhancing Verifiable Voting Systems__: The authors then examine how blockchains could augment existing verifiable voting systems, acknowledging the potential for blockchains to contribute positively in specific scenarios.

+ __Blockchain's Limitations in Voting__: Despite potential benefits, the paper highlights that blockchains are not a universal solution for voting systems, particularly for public sector elections. They emphasize that in most cases, blockchains would play a supporting role within a larger system, rather than being the primary technology.

+ __Cryptographic and End-to-End Verifiable Voting__: The discussion includes cryptographic or end-to-end verifiable (E2E) voting systems, highlighting their ability to provide proof that ballots were included and unmodified in the final tally while maintaining voter privacy.

+ __Blockchain as a Bulletin Board__: One potential use of blockchains in voting systems is as a bulletin board for storing public messages and data related to elections, offering improvements over traditional bulletin board implementations.

+ __Challenges with Deployment and Usability__: The paper raises concerns about the practical deployment of blockchain-based voting systems, including voter interactions, key management, scalability, and the potential for misuse in vote buying.

+ __Potential for Creative Applications__: Despite challenges, the authors recognize the potential for blockchain voting systems to enable creative applications, such as integrating voting with blockchain-based assets and smart contracts.

## Liquid Democracy

### [Short Paper: Ballot Secrecy for Liquid Democracy](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/978-3-662-63958-0_26)

This text appears to be an excerpt from an academic paper discussing the concept of liquid democracy and its implications, particularly focusing on the challenges related to ballot secrecy. Liquid democracy is a voting system where voters have the option to delegate their vote to another person, potentially creating a chain of delegated votes. The paper explores the nuances of this system in the context of governmental elections and referendums, assuming the use of online voting mechanisms.

+ __Liquid Democracy Overview__: The paper introduces liquid democracy as a system allowing vote delegation, potentially suitable for direct democracies with frequent referendums. It distinguishes liquid democracy from traditional delegative democracy, noting its increased attention since the late 2000s, particularly among technologists.

+ __Practical Applications and Experiments__: The text references various implementations and experiments with liquid democracy, such as Liquid Feedback, Google Votes, and blockchain-based solutions. It notes the relatively low usage of vote delegation in these systems and highlights the need for further study in this area.

+ __Challenges with Ballot Secrecy__: A major focus of the paper is the issue of maintaining ballot secrecy in a liquid democracy. This includes the challenges of delegation cycles, unexpected delegations, and accountability of delegates, all of which can impact voter privacy and the integrity of the voting process.

+ __Assumptions for Analysis__: The paper bases its analysis on several assumptions, including the use of online voting, a two-phase voting process (delegation and voting phases), and the potential for multiple concurrent referendums.

+ __Delegation Cycles and Their Impact__: The paper discusses the problem of delegation cycles (where voters inadvertently form a closed loop of delegations) and how they might be detected or prevented. It also addresses the implications of such cycles on the coercion-resistance of the voting system.

+ __Handling Unexpected Delegations__: The issue of voters receiving unexpected delegations is raised, along with the potential privacy implications of systems designed to inform voters about the weight of their delegated votes.

+ __Accountability of Delegates__: The paper explores the balance between maintaining delegate accountability and protecting voter privacy, noting the challenges in designing a system that achieves both objectives.

+ __Concluding Remarks__: The paper concludes that defining the ideal functionality of a liquid democracy system, especially regarding ballot secrecy, is a complex and crucial research question. It suggests that this question needs thorough consideration before proposing new liquid democracy designs.
