## Web3 Governance

+ [2022, The exchange theory of web3 governance](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/kykl.12345)
This paper presents a public choice approach to analyzing governance decisions in the context of Web3, contrasting it with the traditional romantic view of collective decision-making. It explores how individuals in Web3 communities, likened to states, make governance choices that are most beneficial to their private interests, particularly in regards to revenue generation and treasury spending. The paper also discusses constitutional-level changes in Web3 governance, highlighting participatory community decision-making and the potential for governance change through forking, which is decentralized and permissionless.

The paper argues that governance is essential for blockchains due to contractual incompleteness and the need to address emerging issues such as bugs or code upgrades. It differentiates between governance of blockchains (managed by foundations and committees) and governance by blockchains (as in DAOs), and suggests that corporate governance frameworks are more apt for understanding blockchain governance compared to political governance models.

Furthermore, the paper explores how governance in Web3 creates value not only through decision-making but also by expanding possibilities for new exchanges through political entrepreneurship. This innovation in governance is likened to technological innovations that create lasting value.

Several case studies, including Curve Finance, Lido, and the Metagovernance Project, are presented to illustrate these concepts. These examples show how Web3 governance mechanisms, enabled by lower costs of experimentation, facilitate entrepreneurship and discovery of value. They highlight how governance in Web3 is a discovery process under uncertainty, with governance rights being exchanged and coordinated through innovative means.

The paper concludes by asserting that governance innovation in Web3 can be a significant source of value creation. It cautions against overly simplistic governance systems and emphasizes the potential costs of minimizing governance innovation. The paper suggests that more research is needed into the implications of these insights for traditional governance processes, and it anticipates further exploration into the frontiers of Web3 governance.

This paper critically examines the concept of "Code is Law" in the context of Web3 and blockchain technology, tracing its origins to Lawrence Lessig's discussions during the early days of the internet and Web2. It explores how the rise of smart contracts and blockchain technology have given new meaning to this concept, suggesting a shift towards a more algorithm-driven governance system that promises fairness and objectivity. However, the paper highlights the challenges and limitations of such a system, noting that many individuals do not conform to standard statistical models and may be disadvantaged by algorithmic governance.

The paper discusses the potential of blockchain and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) in creating a decentralized society where governance is based on consensus and collective decision-making through tokens. While Web3 promises to shift power from governments and corporations to individuals and token holders, the paper questions whether this will result in a fairer society.

The discussion includes a comparison of power relations in pre-internet, Web1, Web2, and the envisioned Web3 societies. It notes that while the internet initially promised decentralization and participatory systems, Web2 ended up centralizing power with tech giants who control information access. The paper explores how blockchain technology might change these dynamics but cautions that new power struggles could emerge, particularly in controlling the code that governs society.

The paper concludes by suggesting that Web3, like its predecessors, is subject to similar power dynamics and struggles. It questions whether blockchain technology can truly deliver on its promise of a decentralized, fair society, and highlights the potential for continued power imbalances and struggles for control over the governing code.

+ [2023. Designing reward systems for Web3 governance](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/designing-reward-systems-for-web3-governance/)
This article delves into the challenge of democratizing online governance systems, focusing on incentivizing long-term civic participation through rewards. It examines the limitations of current web3 governance systems that rely on transferable tokens, such as tendencies toward plutocracy and low resilience to Sybil attacks. The author suggests alternatives to coin voting, comparing reputation-based and token-based reward systems for governance participation. The historical context shows that political influence has often been wealth-based rather than merit-based, from Ancient Rome to modern liberal democracies.

The paper discusses the difficulty of scaling reputation-based systems, which have been used throughout history in various forms, from medieval guilds to modern credit ratings. It also acknowledges the challenges of existing digital reputation systems, like Google’s PageRank or Reddit’s karma score, which are often niche-specific and prone to fraud.

In the realm of web3, the author sees potential in designing and implementing scalable, merit-based online governance systems using blockchain technology. Two key questions are raised: what behaviors should be rewarded, and who should be rewarded? The paper suggests that in web3 governance, a mix of reputation-based and token-based systems might be optimal, with each having its own trade-offs in terms of accessibility, sybil resistance, and scalability.

The article concludes by highlighting the ongoing debate and experimentation in the space of online democratic governance, emphasizing the need to move beyond simple token-based systems to foster true meritocracy in decentralized governance structures.

+ [2023. A Comprehensive Study of Governance Issues in Decentralized Finance Applications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.01433.pdf)
This paper conducts a comprehensive study of governance issues in Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a key application of smart contracts offering an alternative to centralized finance. The study analyzes 4,446 audit reports from 17 Web3 security companies to categorize governance issues in DeFi applications, using a specially developed taxonomy. It identifies vulnerabilities in governance design and implementation, like flash loan and reentrancy attacks. Employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the paper highlights challenges in maintaining consistency between DeFi applications' code and their whitepapers. The authors also develop and test an AI-based prototype tool on eight DeFi projects, achieving significant accuracy and recall rates. This research aims to assist those involved in DeFi - designers, developers, users, researchers, and regulators - in understanding and addressing governance challenges to promote the sector's healthy development.

+ [2023. Metaverse governance: An empirical analysis of voting within Decentralized Autonomous Organizations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296323001224)

    In this paper we explore the importance of platform governance. We discuss various problems of centralized architecture in the context of the metaverse or sharing economy applications which may lead to monopoly market structures. We argue that open standards and lockchain-based governance can potentially mitigate some of these issues. We then collect governance data from the first blockchain-based virtual world and conduct an empirical analysis to study voter behavior within Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). We provide empirical evidence that open standards and blockchain-based governance are a necessary but not a sufficient condition for a decentralized and neutral platform. Centralization and concentrated voting power may lead to dependencies, rent extraction behavior and create hold-up problems. Consequently, producers, prosumers and service providers must evaluate the governance structure of the platform before establishing a presence.

+ [2023. Web3 Governance Models](https://www.hiro.so/blog/web3-governance-models-an-introduction-to-the-decision-making-process-in-web3-projects)
This article provides an in-depth overview of Web3 governance, explaining its importance in decentralized systems and the various models available for implementation in Web3 projects.

Benefits of Community Governance in Web3 Projects:

Decentralization: Embracing a Web3 governance model can further decentralize a project, aligning with the ethos of Web3 and potentially reaching a broader audience.

Wisdom of the Crowd: Utilizing the collective knowledge and expertise of a community can lead to better decision-making compared to relying solely on a core team.

Transparency and Accountability: Governance models that involve the community enhance transparency and accountability, fostering trust and preventing power abuse.

Risk Management and Stability: Effective governance models can provide clear frameworks for dispute resolution and ensure project continuity even after the departure of founding members.

Community Engagement: Active governance encourages community participation, fostering a deeper connection and commitment to the project.

Types of Web3 Governance Models:

Direct On-Chain Democracy: Allows all community members to vote directly on proposals with votes recorded on the blockchain, but risks plutocracy where wealthier members have more influence.

Direct Off-Chain Democracy: Similar to on-chain democracy but voting occurs off the blockchain, which can be faster and cheaper but introduces trust and security concerns.

Representative Democracy: Like traditional government systems, this model elects representatives to make decisions, balancing efficient decision-making with community input.

Athenian Sortition: Randomly assigns decision-making power to community members to prevent power concentration, but may result in uninformed or unrepresentative decision-making.

Quadratic Democracy: Considers both the number of votes and unique voters to prevent the richest participants from dominating the decision-making process.

Choosing the Right Web3 Governance Model:

The selection of a governance model depends on various factors, including the desired level of decentralization, community size, and required security level. In the early stages of a project, it may be beneficial for founders to maintain decision-making control to develop their vision and achieve product-market fit. As the project matures, transitioning to a more decentralized governance model can be considered. It's important to stay flexible and adapt the governance model as the project and the Web3 industry evolve.
