> __Summary__: _"The Tornado Cash attacker, after gaining control of its governance, proposed to reverse the damage they caused. This followed their successful manipulation of the Tornado Cash DAO, where they granted themselves 1.2 million TORN tokens by swapping part of them for ETH, using a malicious proposal that replaced the original with a self-destruct function. This function allowed them to withdraw all locked governance votes and control the DAO."_

> __Summary__: _"Governance attacks occur when attackers gain enough voting rights to control a project or influence token holders for biased votes. Recent victims include Yam Finance, Beanstalk, and Build Finance DAO.
Preventing governance attacks involves increasing the token amount required for proposal submission when prices are low, educating the community on governance's importance, and ensuring security audits. These measures help protect against the rising risks associated with governance proposals, balancing stakeholder power with security needs."_
