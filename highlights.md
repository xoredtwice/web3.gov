<sub><sup>[[Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19201)]</sup></sub>

The paper "Open Problems in DAOs" provides a comprehensive overview of the challenges and research opportunities related to Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). DAOs are a new class of organizations governed by smart contracts, typically on a blockchain, and they represent a significant shift from traditional organizational structures. The paper is multi-disciplinary, touching on aspects of __computer science__, __economics__, __law__, __ethics__, __organizational science__, __political science__, and __philosophy__.

+ __Computer Science__: Explores problems like granular privacy, private execution, new computational substrates, secure voting, modeling and formal verification for governance, human-computer interaction for DAO interfaces, DAOs as social computing systems, measures of decentralization, democratic infrastructures for governing technology, data sets and data standards, and automated testing and experimentation.

    + __Granular Privacy in DAOs__: Granular privacy is a critical issue in DAOs, balancing the need for transparency in operations with strategic discretion. This balance is essential for effective functioning in various strategic and social settings. Cryptographic advancements, including zero-knowledge proofs and secure multiparty computation, offer solutions to these privacy concerns. They allow for composable privacy primitives that enable DAOs and their participants to maintain strategic flexibility while operating on public ledgers.

    + __Private DAO Execution__: The need for private execution in DAOs highlights the tension between maintaining transparency and protecting strategic interests. While some tools for private execution exist, more work is needed to fully integrate these solutions into DAO operations. This involves developing private contract execution methods and integrating them with existing chains, creating hybrid models that balance privacy with public execution. The challenge lies in retaining the DAO's autonomous character while offering greater execution privacy.

    + __New Computational Substrates for DAOs__: The exploration of new computational substrates for DAOs is a key area of interest. This involves improving the properties of these substrates, such as blockchains, to enhance their functionality and interoperability. Research in computer networking, cryptography, and distributed computing plays a significant role in developing these new substrates, offering solutions to scalability and security challenges and creating opportunities for DAOs to operate on multiple chains or computational platforms effectively.

    + __Secure Voting in DAOs__: Secure voting is central to DAO governance, requiring robust mechanisms to ensure trustworthiness. The challenge lies in designing voting systems that are secure along several dimensions, including integrity, public verifiability, privacy, and coercion-resistance. This involves translating cryptographic concepts and tools from the literature on verifiable voting to the unique context of DAOs, where voting is digital, pseudonymous, and often token-weighted. Achieving a balance between these security properties, especially between integrity and privacy, is a critical focus for future research.

    + __Modeling and Formal Verification for Governance__: The complexity of DAOs necessitates the development of models and formal verification methods to anticipate and constrain potential failures. This involves applying mathematical methods to prove the correctness of algorithms and using game theory and computer-aided design tools for governance systems. These methodologies help in understanding the dynamics of DAOs, testing various configurations.

    + __Automated Testing and Experimentation for DAOs__: The development of a rigorous framework for automated testing and experimentation is essential for advancing DAOs. Currently, experimentation in DAOs mostly occurs outside academic settings, and there is a significant need for tools that facilitate the development, deployment, and testing of DAOs. Automated testing could focus on various aspects such as resilience to attacks, responsiveness in crises, decision-making processes, and financial stability. The creation of benchmarks and challenges, akin to fire drills or war games, could help DAOs test their capacity and preparedness for various scenarios. Additionally, integrating DAO frameworks with testing tools could significantly enhance the experimental landscape, allowing for more effective and efficient research and development in the field.

    + __Human-Computer Interaction for DAO Interfaces__: The usability of DAOs presents a significant challenge, making human-computer interaction (HCI) crucial for designing better interfaces and systems. Currently, the steep learning curve and the technical nature of interactions in DAOs limit their accessibility. HCI can play a vital role in making DAOs more inclusive and user-friendly by designing systems that cater to diverse expertise levels, languages, and accessibility needs. Rigorous HCI methodologies can improve the design process, ensuring that interfaces like dashboards and visualizations are effective and user-centric. Additionally, HCI research can explore specific design interventions to enhance participation and decision-making in DAO governance, evaluating cognitive and social factors that influence these processes.

    + __DAOs as Social Computing Systems__: DAOs, as digital organizations, align closely with the domain of social computing, which studies the interaction between people, technology, and society. Social computing provides a framework for understanding and designing computing systems that focus on social groups and behavior. This perspective is particularly relevant for DAOs, as they represent a novel form of socio-technical system. Research in social computing can explore how technological design choices in DAOs influence social behavior and interaction, how social structures shape the use and understanding of DAO technologies, and how to design DAO technology to support specific social behaviors or outcomes. This approach positions DAOs within a broader context of digital institutions and emphasizes the role of technology in shaping social processes.

    + __Measures of Decentralization in DAOs__: Developing standardized metrics and definitions of decentralization is a key research area in DAOs. Current research explores various approaches, such as entropy-based indices, voting concentration analyses, and empirical studies of governance participation. These studies aim to understand the current landscape of decentralization, its value, and its structures. They also seek to incorporate the role of various actors, like foundations, into measures of decentralization. Understanding the motivations for decentralization, whether economic, regulatory, technical, or ideological, is crucial in assessing and improving the decentralized nature of DAOs.

    + __Democratic Infrastructures for Governing Technology in DAOs__: DAOs represent a shift in the governance of technology, focusing more on community involvement rather than traditional regulatory mechanisms. This approach is different from the conventional governance of technology, which often relies on institutions and legal frameworks. DAOs foreground the role of technology and local communities in governance processes. However, the scope of technologies governed by DAOs is currently limited mainly to blockchain-based protocols and contracts. Expanding DAO governance to broader technologies, such as server infrastructure or AI models, presents an opportunity to involve affected parties more directly in the governance process.

    + __Data Sets and Data Standards for DAOs__: Despite the public and transparent nature of DAOs, researching them is challenging due to a lack of standardization, reliance on off-chain services, and difficulties in data indexing and integration. Defining standardized data sets, schemas, and taxonomies is crucial for easier data collection, experimentation, and statistical analysis. Challenges include determining the actual members of a DAO, understanding the contract space, and assessing engagement levels over time. Developing live data sets through automated mechanisms, technical standards, and institutional designs could provide valuable insights for both scientific analysis and real-time feedback to DAOs. This would not only benefit researchers but also enhance the operational, reporting, and governance capabilities of DAOs themselves.

+ __Economics__: Addresses institutional economics and its application to DAOs, exploring the economic rationale for DAOs, their organizational efficiency, and governance structures.

    + __Institutional Economics__: This part of the discussion situates DAOs within the framework of institutional economics. It draws parallels between DAOs and traditional firms in terms of their role in minimizing transaction costs and 'costs of trust.' The paper uses Coase’s theory of the firm as a foundation, suggesting that DAOs, like firms, are formed to economize on transaction costs associated with market exchanges. It posits that DAOs could be seen as a technological evolution in organizational forms, designed to address specific inefficiencies in traditional organizational structures.

    + __Integration with Traditional Economic Theories__: The paper integrates DAOs into the broader context of voluntary or private organizations, including economic theories of clubs and commons. This approach looks at DAOs as entities that involve governance, collective decision-making, and the creation and management of common pool resources or local public goods.

    + __Overlap with Theory of the Firm__: The economics of DAOs is aligned with the standard economic theory of the firm, encompassing areas like agency contracting, entrepreneurship, investment under uncertainty, team production, asset specificity, and corporate governance. The paper discusses how these traditional concepts of economic organization might apply or need to be adapted for DAOs.

    + __New Institutional Economics Focus__: The paper emphasizes the relevance of New Institutional Economics in understanding DAOs. This field examines the comparative advantages of organizational forms (including DAOs) for coordinating resources and individuals, especially in contexts involving asymmetric information, opportunism, and trust issues. The paper suggests that DAOs might present new ways to resolve these challenges through their decentralized and digital nature.

    + __Integration with Club and Commons Theory__: The section also touches on how DAOs fit into the economic theory of clubs and the economic theory of commons. This is particularly relevant in understanding the governance structures of DAOs, their decision-making processes, and how they handle shared resources or goods.

+ __Ethics__: Discusses the ethical considerations surrounding DAOs, including their potential to be unethical, whether they can be considered moral agents, and how to run an ethical DAO.

    + __Can DAOs be Unethical?__: This part of the section raises the question of whether DAOs, as algorithmically governed entities, can engage in unethical behavior. The paper discusses the potential for DAOs to be used for unethical purposes, given their automated and decentralized nature. It explores the implications of DAOs' actions in the broader context of societal norms and ethics, considering how the design and use of DAOs can lead to outcomes that may be deemed unethical.

    + __Are DAOs Moral Agents?__: Here, the paper tackles the complex issue of moral agency in the context of DAOs. It questions whether DAOs, as non-human entities driven by code, can be considered moral agents responsible for their actions. The discussion revolves around the allocation of moral responsibility: whether it lies with the DAO itself or with its creators, operators, or users. The paper contemplates the extent to which DAOs, as programmed entities, can bear moral responsibility.

    + __Running an Ethical DAO__: This part of the section focuses on the principles and guidelines for operating DAOs ethically. It considers the governance structures, decision-making processes, and the incorporation of ethical considerations into DAO operations. The paper discusses the importance of designing DAOs in a way that aligns with ethical standards and societal values. It highlights the need for transparency, accountability, and fair practices in the operation of DAOs to ensure they contribute positively to society and do not perpetrate harm.

+ __Law__: Covers the legal aspects of DAOs, including their legal definition, liability, financial regulation, incorporation and legal recognition, and dispute resolution systems.

    + __Legal Definition__:  The paper starts by discussing the challenge of defining DAOs within existing legal frameworks. Given their novel and decentralized nature, DAOs don't fit neatly into traditional legal categories. The section explores how the law might evolve to recognize DAOs, considering the implications of such recognition for regulatory compliance and legal accountability.

    + __Legal Liability__: A central concern addressed is the issue of legal liability in DAOs. Due to the decentralized and often anonymous nature of DAOs, determining liability when things go wrong is complex. The paper discusses potential frameworks for attributing liability within DAOs, considering how decentralized decision-making processes complicate traditional legal approaches to liability.

    + __Financial Regulation__: The paper delves into how DAOs intersect with financial laws and regulations. This includes discussions on securities law, taxation, and anti-money laundering regulations. The section examines the challenges in applying existing financial regulations to DAOs and suggests areas where regulatory frameworks might need to be adapted or reinterpreted.

    + __Incorporation and Legal Recognition__:  Incorporation and legal recognition of DAOs are significant themes. The section explores how DAOs can be structured legally and recognized as entities, considering their unique organizational characteristics. It discusses different models for legally incorporating DAOs and the implications of these models for governance, taxation, and legal compliance.

    + __Dispute Resolution Systems__: Lastly, the section addresses the need for effective dispute resolution mechanisms within DAOs. Given their autonomous and decentralized governance structures, traditional dispute resolution methods may not be applicable. The section explores how DAOs might develop internal mechanisms for resolving conflicts and what role smart contracts could play in this process.


+ __Organizational Science__: Investigates DAOs from an organizational perspective, including topics like organizational imprinting, evolutionary social science, neo-institutional theory, organizations as complex adaptive systems, organizational methodology in the era of complete data, and organizational ethnography.

    + __Organizational Imprinting__: The concept of organizational imprinting is explored in relation to DAOs. This idea suggests that the early conditions, such as founding principles, technological infrastructure, and initial governance models, can leave a lasting imprint on a DAO's culture, structure, and operational approach. The paper discusses how these initial conditions might shape the long-term evolution and behavior of DAOs.

    + __Evolutionary Social Science__: Here, the paper examines DAOs through an evolutionary lens, considering how they adapt and evolve over time. This includes looking at how DAOs respond to internal dynamics, such as changes in membership and governance models, as well as external factors like market conditions and regulatory changes. The aim is to understand the evolutionary paths that DAOs might take and the factors influencing their development.

    + __Neo-Institutional Theory__: The application of neo-institutional theory to DAOs is another focus. This theory typically explores how structures become institutionalized within society. The paper considers how DAOs, as new forms of organizational structures, achieve legitimacy and how they might be influenced by or influence existing institutional norms and practices.

    + __Organizations as Complex Adaptive Systems__:  In this part, DAOs are viewed as complex adaptive systems. This perspective sees DAOs as dynamic entities whose behaviors and outcomes emerge from the interactions of their members. The paper discusses the implications of this view for understanding the governance, decision-making processes, and overall dynamics of DAOs.

    + __Organizational Methodology in the Era of Complete Data__: The paper highlights the unique opportunity provided by DAOs due to their digital and transparent nature, which allows access to comprehensive data sets. It discusses how this can revolutionize organizational research methodologies, enabling more detailed and real-time analyses of organizational behavior and dynamics.

    + __Organizational Ethnography__: The paper advocates for the use of organizational ethnography to study DAOs. Given their novel nature, qualitative and ethnographic research methods are posited as valuable tools for gaining deeper insights into the unique cultures, practices, and social dynamics within DAOs.

+ __Political Science and Philosophy__: Examines DAOs in the context of political science and philosophy, exploring institutions, turnout, real-time experimentation, self-governance, global governance, and political philosophy.

    + __Institutions__:  The paper examines DAOs as new forms of institutional frameworks. It discusses how DAOs, governed by coded rules and decentralized consensus mechanisms, represent a departure from conventional institutional structures. The emphasis is on understanding the role of DAOs as digitally-native institutions that operate with different rules and dynamics compared to traditional organizations.

    + __Turnout__:  A significant focus is on the participation of members in DAO governance, particularly voter turnout for decision-making. The paper probes into the dynamics of participation within DAOs, considering what motivates or hinders member engagement in the voting process. It raises questions about the implications of varying levels of turnout on the effectiveness and legitimacy of decisions made within DAOs.

    + __Real-time Experimentation__: DAOs are presented as platforms for real-time political experimentation. Their transparent and digital nature allows for an unprecedented opportunity to test various governance models and policies in a live environment. The paper discusses how this aspect of DAOs can provide valuable insights into political science and governance studies.

    + __Self-governance__: The concept of self-governance is a crucial theme in this section. It delves into how DAOs facilitate a form of governance that is largely autonomous and decentralized, often functioning without a traditional hierarchical structure. This challenges existing notions of authority and governance, offering a new perspective on how groups can self-organize and manage collective decision-making.

    + __Global Governance__: The paper also addresses the role of DAOs in the context of global governance. Given their borderless nature, DAOs offer a unique perspective on international cooperation and governance. The discussion centers on how DAOs might interact with, complement, or challenge existing global governance mechanisms.

    + __Political Philosophy__: The paper explores the philosophical implications of DAOs, particularly in the context of democratic theory, authority, and power. It considers how the emergence of DAOs might influence our understanding of these concepts and contribute to the evolution of political philosophy. The section suggests that DAOs offer a practical example to test and refine political theories in a digital and decentralized context.

<sub><sup>[[Link](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbloc.2023.1109544/full)]</sup></sub>

This paper critically examines the concept of "Code is Law" in the context of Web3 and blockchain technology, tracing its origins to Lawrence Lessig's discussions during the early days of the internet and Web2. It explores how the rise of smart contracts and blockchain technology have given new meaning to this concept, suggesting a shift towards a more algorithm-driven governance system that promises fairness and objectivity. However, the paper highlights the challenges and limitations of such a system, noting that many individuals do not conform to standard statistical models and may be disadvantaged by algorithmic governance.

The paper discusses the potential of blockchain and Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) in creating a decentralized society where governance is based on consensus and collective decision-making through tokens. While Web3 promises to shift power from governments and corporations to individuals and token holders, the paper questions whether this will result in a fairer society.

The discussion includes a comparison of power relations in pre-internet, Web1, Web2, and the envisioned Web3 societies. It notes that while the internet initially promised decentralization and participatory systems, Web2 ended up centralizing power with tech giants who control information access. The paper explores how blockchain technology might change these dynamics but cautions that new power struggles could emerge, particularly in controlling the code that governs society.

The paper concludes by suggesting that Web3, like its predecessors, is subject to similar power dynamics and struggles. It questions whether blockchain technology can truly deliver on its promise of a decentralized, fair society, and highlights the potential for continued power imbalances and struggles for control over the governing code.

<sub><sup>[[Link](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/designing-reward-systems-for-web3-governance/)]</sup></sub>

This article delves into the challenge of democratizing online governance systems, focusing on incentivizing long-term civic participation through rewards. It examines the limitations of current web3 governance systems that rely on transferable tokens, such as tendencies toward plutocracy and low resilience to Sybil attacks. The author suggests alternatives to coin voting, comparing reputation-based and token-based reward systems for governance participation. The historical context shows that political influence has often been wealth-based rather than merit-based, from Ancient Rome to modern liberal democracies.

The paper discusses the difficulty of scaling reputation-based systems, which have been used throughout history in various forms, from medieval guilds to modern credit ratings. It also acknowledges the challenges of existing digital reputation systems, like Google’s PageRank or Reddit’s karma score, which are often niche-specific and prone to fraud.

In the realm of web3, the author sees potential in designing and implementing scalable, merit-based online governance systems using blockchain technology. Two key questions are raised: what behaviors should be rewarded, and who should be rewarded? The paper suggests that in web3 governance, a mix of reputation-based and token-based systems might be optimal, with each having its own trade-offs in terms of accessibility, sybil resistance, and scalability.

The article concludes by highlighting the ongoing debate and experimentation in the space of online democratic governance, emphasizing the need to move beyond simple token-based systems to foster true meritocracy in decentralized governance structures.

<sub><sup>[[Link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296323001224)]</sup></sub>

In this paper we explore the importance of platform governance. We discuss various problems of centralized architecture in the context of the metaverse or sharing economy applications which may lead to monopoly market structures. We argue that open standards and lockchain-based governance can potentially mitigate some of these issues. We then collect governance data from the first blockchain-based virtual world and conduct an empirical analysis to study voter behavior within Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). 
The paper
 provides empirical evidence that open standards and blockchain-based governance are a necessary but not a sufficient condition for a decentralized and neutral platform. Centralization and concentrated voting power may lead to dependencies, rent extraction behavior and create hold-up problems. Consequently, producers, prosumers and service providers must evaluate the governance structure of the platform before establishing a presence.

<sub><sup>[[Link](https://www.hiro.so/blog/web3-governance-models-an-introduction-to-the-decision-making-process-in-web3-projects)]</sup></sub>

This article provides an in-depth overview of Web3 governance, explaining its importance in decentralized systems and the various models available for implementation in Web3 projects.

+ Benefits of Community Governance in Web3 Projects:

    + __Decentralization__: Embracing a Web3 governance model can further decentralize a project, aligning with the ethos of Web3 and potentially reaching a broader audience.

    + __Wisdom of the Crowd__: Utilizing the collective knowledge and expertise of a community can lead to better decision-making compared to relying solely on a core team.

    + __Transparency and Accountability__: Governance models that involve the community enhance transparency and accountability, fostering trust and preventing power abuse.

    + __Risk Management and Stability__: Effective governance models can provide clear frameworks for dispute resolution and ensure project continuity even after the departure of founding members.

    + __Community Engagement__: Active governance encourages community participation, fostering a deeper connection and commitment to the project.

+ Types of Web3 Governance Models:

    + __Direct On-Chain Democracy__: Allows all community members to vote directly on proposals with votes recorded on the blockchain, but risks plutocracy where wealthier members have more influence.

    + __Direct Off-Chain Democracy__: Similar to on-chain democracy but voting occurs off the blockchain, which can be faster and cheaper but introduces trust and security concerns.

    + __Representative Democracy__: Like traditional government systems, this model elects representatives to make decisions, balancing efficient decision-making with community input.

    + __Athenian Sortition__: Randomly assigns decision-making power to community members to prevent power concentration, but may result in uninformed or unrepresentative decision-making.

    + __Quadratic Democracy__: Considers both the number of votes and unique voters to prevent the richest participants from dominating the decision-making process.

+ Choosing the Right Web3 Governance Model:

    The selection of a governance model depends on various factors, including the __desired level of decentralization__, __community size__, and __required security level__. In the early stages of a project, it may be beneficial for founders to maintain decision-making control to develop their vision and achieve product-market fit. As the project matures, transitioning to a more decentralized governance model can be considered. It's important to stay flexible and adapt the governance model as the project and the Web3 industry evolve.

#### <a name="2022-web3-exchange-theory"></a> The exchange theory of web3 governance (2022)
<sub><sup>[[Link](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/kykl.12345)]</sup></sub>


This paper presents a public choice approach to analyzing governance decisions in the context of Web3, contrasting it with the traditional romantic view of collective decision-making. It explores how individuals in Web3 communities, likened to states, make governance choices that are most beneficial to their private interests, particularly in regards to revenue generation and treasury spending. The paper also discusses constitutional-level changes in Web3 governance, highlighting participatory community decision-making and the potential for governance change through forking, which is decentralized and permissionless.

The paper argues that governance is essential for blockchains due to contractual incompleteness and the need to address emerging issues such as bugs or code upgrades. It differentiates between governance of blockchains (managed by foundations and committees) and governance by blockchains (as in DAOs), and suggests that corporate governance frameworks are more apt for understanding blockchain governance compared to political governance models.

Furthermore, the paper explores how governance in Web3 creates value not only through decision-making but also by expanding possibilities for new exchanges through political entrepreneurship. This innovation in governance is likened to technological innovations that create lasting value.

Several case studies, including Curve Finance, Lido, and the Meta-governance Project, are presented to illustrate these concepts. These examples show how Web3 governance mechanisms, enabled by lower costs of experimentation, facilitate entrepreneurship and discovery of value. They highlight how governance in Web3 is a discovery process under uncertainty, with governance rights being exchanged and coordinated through innovative means.

The paper concludes by asserting that governance innovation in Web3 can be a significant source of value creation. It cautions against overly simplistic governance systems and emphasizes the potential costs of minimizing governance innovation. The paper suggests that more research is needed into the implications of these insights for traditional governance processes, and it anticipates further exploration into the frontiers of Web3 governance.

This article discusses the evolution of blockchain technology and its implications for Internet governance, particularly focusing on the emerging concept of Web3.

Key Points:

__Blockchain Technology__: Introduced with Bitcoin in 2009, blockchains allow digital transactions to be verified and recorded in a decentralized manner. They do not rely on a central authority like a bank or government, instead using a network consensus to confirm transactions. This technology is viewed as enhancing trust in the Internet and providing a form of digital peer regulation.

__Blockchain's Impact and Controversies__: Blockchains have captured public attention and resources across various sectors. The technology has been both celebrated for its potential and criticized for enabling scams and fraud. Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) are examples of blockchain applications that have gone through cycles of hype and skepticism.

__Web3 - A Push for Unity__: Web3, starting to emerge in 2021, is seen as a unifying movement in the blockchain space, seeking to return to the decentralized nature of the early Internet (Web 1.0). Unlike the fragmented and factional landscape of previous blockchain applications, Web3 aims for greater interoperability among various blockchain protocols and with existing Web 2.0 structures.

__Implications for Internet Governance__: The push for unity in Web3 tends to emphasize technical interoperability at the cost of socio-economic diversity. Web3 is critiqued for reproducing existing socio-economic inequalities and for its narrow focus on technical aspects rather than broader inclusivity.

__Regulatory Responses__: As blockchain applications grow, they face increased regulatory scrutiny globally. This has prompted Web3 advocates to emphasize self-regulation and interoperability as a way to avoid or pre-empt official regulatory control.

__Challenges and Future Directions__: Despite its promise, the unity in Web3 might not last, as it raises high expectations and faces debates about its role in Internet governance. The article suggests that the future of the Internet, be it Web3, Web 4.0, or Web5, should focus on overcoming the challenges of Web 2.0 rather than recreating them.

#### <a name="2022-web3-wrong-question"></a> Web3 wrong question (2022)
<sub><sup>[[Link](https://www.wired.com/story/web3-blockchain-decentralization-governance/)]</sup></sub>

This article discusses the concept of decentralization in the context of Web3 and expresses concerns about the current direction of decentralization in this domain. Authored by Divya Siddarth, Danielle Allen, and E. Glen Weyl, the article argues that while decentralization can combat issues like erosion of freedom and economic stagnation, the focus should be on the type of decentralization rather than its degree.

Key Points of the Article:

+ __Misguided Focus on Degree of Decentralization__: The authors argue that Web3’s focus on the degree of decentralization rather than its type can lead to misconceptions about both existing centralization and the feasibility of complete decentralization. They note that existing systems, often labeled as centralized, have elements of decentralization, and that extreme decentralization in Web3 could lead to inefficiencies and the re-emergence of centralized entities.

+ __Inefficiencies and Contradictions in Narrow Technical Decentralization__: The article points out that the narrow technical approach to decentralization in Web3, such as in distributed ledgers, faces inherent contradictions. This approach can result in either reduced functionality or the emergence of some form of centralized decision-making.

+ __The Value of Decentralization in Empowering Action__: Decentralization, according to the authors, should empower people to act decisively within their social contexts while allowing for coordination across different contexts. This contrasts with the current trend where decision-making is often centralized in the hands of distant authorities.

+ __Composable Local Control as an Alternative__: The authors propose a model of decentralization based on composable local control. This model focuses on solving problems through federations of local units that are relevant to the decision at hand. This approach draws on the principle of subsidiarity, which emphasizes solving problems at the most immediate level that is feasible.

+ __Challenges with Distributed Redundancy__: The current Web3 model, which relies on distributed redundancy, is critiqued for removing data from its social context, aiming for universal solutions, and depending on global consensus. This model is seen as being in tension with subsidiary networks.

+ __Potential for Web3 to Redirect Towards Subsidiarity__: The authors express optimism that Web3 and related technologies can shift towards a model of subsidiarity. However, they emphasize the need for Web3 to evolve into a network of networks, rather than just a ledger.

+ __Efficiency and Security in Subsidiarity__: Contrary to the distributed redundancy model, subsidiarity can increase efficiency by leveraging trust and relationships, rather than diminishing efficiency to eliminate the need for trust.

<sub><sup>[[Link](https://blog.chain.link/daos/)]</sup></sub>

This comprehensive article from Chainlink provides an in-depth exploration of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) and their role in the governance of Web3. It covers various aspects of DAOs, including their types, responsibilities, tooling, governance structures, benefits, trade-offs, and the future outlook.

Key-points:

+ __Definition and Purpose of DAOs__: DAOs (Decentralized Autonomous Organizations) are blockchain-based structures for collective decision-making. They are not fully autonomous as they require human interaction for functions like voting and deploying code. DAOs use smart contracts to execute decisions and assign ownership.

+ __Types of DAOs__: The article categorizes DAOs into several types including Protocol DAOs, Investment DAOs, Cause-based DAOs, Social DAOs, Data DAOs, and Network States. Each type serves different purposes, from managing decentralized applications to making investments or supporting specific causes.

+ __Responsibilities of DAOs__:Responsibilities include managing open-source protocol upgrades, setting parameters within decentralized applications (dApps), directing protocol-owned funds, and more.

+ __DAO Tooling__:Tools essential for DAO functioning are outlined, such as governance tokens, multi-signature wallets, voting contracts, delegation systems, off-chain snapshots, discussion forums, and reputation systems.


+ __Governance Structures in DAOs__:The article discusses various governance structures like direct on-chain democracy, direct off-chain democracy, representative democracy, and quadratic democracy, explaining how they function and their implications.

+ __Benefits of DAOs__: Benefits include transparency, democratization, trust-minimization, and global participation.

+ __Tradeoffs and Challenges in DAO Governance__: Key trade-offs are analyzed across multiple dichotomies such as Early-Stage vs. Late-Stage Members, Decentralization vs. Efficiency, Stabilization vs. Growth, Leaderless vs. Leadership, Short-Term vs. Long-Term Priorities, Knowledgeable vs. Unknowledgeable Members, and Nothing-at-Stake vs. Hyper-Financialization.

+ __The Future of DAOs__: The article acknowledges that DAOs are still in their infancy and their evolution is uncertain. It highlights the need for experimentation to develop diverse and effective governance models.

<sub><sup>[[Link](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1007/978-3-662-63958-0_26)]</sup></sub>

This text appears to be an excerpt from an academic paper discussing the concept of liquid democracy and its implications, particularly focusing on the challenges related to ballot secrecy. Liquid democracy is a voting system where voters have the option to delegate their vote to another person, potentially creating a chain of delegated votes. The paper explores the nuances of this system in the context of governmental elections and referendums, assuming the use of online voting mechanisms.

+ __Liquid Democracy Overview__: The paper introduces liquid democracy as a system allowing vote delegation, potentially suitable for direct democracies with frequent referendums. It distinguishes liquid democracy from traditional delegative democracy, noting its increased attention since the late 2000s, particularly among technologists.

+ __Practical Applications and Experiments__: The text references various implementations and experiments with liquid democracy, such as Liquid Feedback, Google Votes, and blockchain-based solutions. It notes the relatively low usage of vote delegation in these systems and highlights the need for further study in this area.

+ __Challenges with Ballot Secrecy__: A major focus of the paper is the issue of maintaining ballot secrecy in a liquid democracy. This includes the challenges of delegation cycles, unexpected delegations, and accountability of delegates, all of which can impact voter privacy and the integrity of the voting process.

+ __Assumptions for Analysis__: The paper bases its analysis on several assumptions, including the use of online voting, a two-phase voting process (delegation and voting phases), and the potential for multiple concurrent referendums.

+ __Delegation Cycles and Their Impact__: The paper discusses the problem of delegation cycles (where voters inadvertently form a closed loop of delegations) and how they might be detected or prevented. It also addresses the implications of such cycles on the coercion-resistance of the voting system.

+ __Handling Unexpected Delegations__: The issue of voters receiving unexpected delegations is raised, along with the potential privacy implications of systems designed to inform voters about the weight of their delegated votes.

+ __Accountability of Delegates__: The paper explores the balance between maintaining delegate accountability and protecting voter privacy, noting the challenges in designing a system that achieves both objectives.

+ __Concluding Remarks__: The paper concludes that defining the ideal functionality of a liquid democracy system, especially regarding ballot secrecy, is a complex and crucial research question. It suggests that this question needs thorough consideration before proposing new liquid democracy designs.

<sub><sup>[[Link](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Blockchains-and-Voting%3A-Somewhere-between-hype-and-Nasser-Okoye/397f569d89af9c35f5fa67c738e2f705bb328368)]</sup></sub>

This position paper by Yomna Nasser, Chidinma Okoye, Jeremy Clark, and Peter Y.A. Ryan explores the potential and limitations of blockchain technology in the context of voting systems. The authors systematically examine both the challenges of implementing a voting system on a blockchain and how blockchain might enhance existing verifiable voting systems. They conclude that while blockchains can be a useful augmentation for verifiable voting in certain circumstances and may introduce innovative ways of voting in non-traditional settings, they are not a panacea for all voting system issues.

Paper key-points:

+ __Blockchain as a Voting System Base__: The paper begins by considering the challenges of building a voting system on a blockchain, including issues related to voter anonymity, registration, and the transparency of the voting process.

+ __Enhancing Verifiable Voting Systems__: The authors then examine how blockchains could augment existing verifiable voting systems, acknowledging the potential for blockchains to contribute positively in specific scenarios.

+ __Blockchain's Limitations in Voting__: Despite potential benefits, the paper highlights that blockchains are not a universal solution for voting systems, particularly for public sector elections. They emphasize that in most cases, blockchains would play a supporting role within a larger system, rather than being the primary technology.

+ __Cryptographic and End-to-End Verifiable Voting__: The discussion includes cryptographic or end-to-end verifiable (E2E) voting systems, highlighting their ability to provide proof that ballots were included and unmodified in the final tally while maintaining voter privacy.

+ __Blockchain as a Bulletin Board__: One potential use of blockchains in voting systems is as a bulletin board for storing public messages and data related to elections, offering improvements over traditional bulletin board implementations.

+ __Challenges with Deployment and Usability__: The paper raises concerns about the practical deployment of blockchain-based voting systems, including voter interactions, key management, scalability, and the potential for misuse in vote buying.

+ __Potential for Creative Applications__: Despite challenges, the authors recognize the potential for blockchain voting systems to enable creative applications, such as integrating voting with blockchain-based assets and smart contracts.
